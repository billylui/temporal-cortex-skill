**v0.9.0** · March 2026 · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) · **Website:** [temporal-cortex.com](https://temporal-cortex.com)

Agent Skills that teach AI agents to schedule meetings with anyone — from finding contacts to booking or sending proposals. Built on the [Temporal Cortex MCP server](https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp) with 18 tools across 5 layers. Compatible with 26+ agent platforms.

## Skills

| Skill | Description | Tools |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| [temporal-cortex](skills/temporal-cortex/SKILL.md) | Router — routes calendar intents to sub-skills | All 18 |
| [temporal-cortex-datetime](skills/temporal-cortex-datetime/SKILL.md) | Time resolution, timezone conversion, duration math (no credentials needed) | 5 |
| [temporal-cortex-scheduling](skills/temporal-cortex-scheduling/SKILL.md) | Contact resolution, calendar ops, availability, booking, and Open Scheduling | 14 |
| [calendar-scheduling](skills/calendar-scheduling/SKILL.md) | Legacy alias for temporal-cortex (auto-generated) | All 18 |

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add temporal-cortex/skills
```

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporal-cortex/skills.git
cp -r skills/temporal-cortex* ~/.claude/skills/
```

## MCP Server Connection

All skills share one MCP server. The included [.mcp.json](.mcp.json) provides the default configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "temporal-cortex": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Layer 1 tools (temporal context, datetime resolution) work immediately. Calendar tools require a one-time OAuth setup:

```bash
npx @temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp auth google     # Google Calendar
npx @temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp auth outlook    # Microsoft Outlook
npx @temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp auth caldav     # CalDAV (iCloud, Fastmail)
```

## FAQ

### What agent platforms support these skills?

The skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) and work with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, OpenAI Codex CLI, Google Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and 20+ other platforms.

### Can I use datetime skills without calendar credentials?

Yes. The `temporal-cortex-datetime` skill works immediately with zero setup — no OAuth or API keys needed. All 5 tools are pure computation with no external API calls.

### What happened to `calendar-scheduling`?

The original `calendar-scheduling` skill was renamed to `temporal-cortex` at v0.5.1 when it was decomposed into a router + 2 focused sub-skills. The `calendar-scheduling` slug is still published on all directories as a backward-compatible alias — it is auto-generated from the router SKILL.md and installs the same MCP server.

### How do the router and sub-skills interact?

The router skill (`temporal-cortex`) knows the full 7-step workflow and routes to the appropriate sub-skill based on intent. For a full scheduling workflow (resolve time → check availability → book), the agent progresses through datetime → scheduling sub-skills.
